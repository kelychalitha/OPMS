# OPMS
Online Pharmacy Management System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope of the System

This system has three main parts. There is,

 Customer

 Supplier

 Admin

This system is online pharmacy management system. There main given facility to 
order online medicine and supply online pharmacies. Mostly this is very useful and 
helpful on this covid-19 pandemic situation. Here I mention below what task doing 
these main rolls. 

Customer – customer is the one of the major roll in our system. In this system, if 
customer need to order medicine firstly they have to register with our system. After 
create their account they can have chance to login their account. After they can see 
what available pharmacies in this system. After they can add to order with uploading 
their prescription. After they doing the payment they will receive their medicine to 
doorstop.

Supplier – supplier is one of the major roll in our system. In this system, if supplier 
need to selling their medicine, firstly they have to register with our system. After 
register their pharmacy they can have facility to login their account and supplier can 
check order status, view order, send invoice, watch their order history. In this system 
supplier task is, after receive order, they can send to invoice for the customer. After 
customer did the online payment, supplier have to deliver for their location.

Admin – admin is on of the major roll in our system. Admin have to permission for 
control suppliers’ accounts and manage contact request. If the supplier doing some 
illegal or selling some bad medicine, admin can deactivate their account. This action 
taken for system security and keep the medicine quality. Also admin can watch 
customers’ or suppliers’ or anyone contact request. So admin can see their 
messages.

Technologies that are used to develop OPMS 

We created a web application and a mobile application with an API.

• Web Application

We created the web application of OPMS, by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
bootstrap and we used PHP to connect the API with the web application.

• Mobile Application

1. We created the mobile application using flutter with dart language.
2. In flutter is everything is a widget, widgets are used to create the 
frontend of a mobile application. As the OPMS uses a WebAPI to 
communicate between the server and the other applications. 
Therefore, flutter http package and flutter covert library were used as 
libraries. 
3. The mobile applications which are developed using flutter will run on 
both Android and IOS. So using one application is satisfied for both 
operating systems.
4. Hot reloading is a main function in flutter.
5. Simple platform and attractive UI design

API

Application Programming Interface (API) provide data/ information gateway that 
permits to communicate with backend of the software or the application with each 
other. Through this API application will be interconnected and become suitable and 
provide up-to-date digital experience or we can tell that two applications can 
communicate each other using the API. Interact and can access information/ data with 
operating systems, external software components and API can give response to user 
and can send response back to a user.

These are the middleware used in node js to develop the API.

➢ Express. Js

Express js is an open source and free web application framework for node.js. This 
gives speed processing and it is reliable. 
Express use to provide server-side logic for web and mobile application, it is used for 
up robust APIS. 

➢ Bcrypt. Js

Bcrypt.js is used for password hash () and password verify (). 
Brypt.js is a true way to hash and store passwords. 

➢ Core.js

Core js is a client-side JS library.
It uses for creating event -driven JS codes and object-oriented codes.
Core.js helps to enable the web access. 

➢ Body-parser 

This body-parser object exposes various kind of factories to create middleware. This 
is used to read HTTP POST data, and this read a form’s input and stores it as a 
JavaScript object.
